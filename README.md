# chudriver

## Introduction
This project was initiated to provide friendly APIs for the usage of spreadsheets and buckets. Then my needs expanded to other services and I hope to combine all common and useful functionalities to one place as reference and also help people to get started.

## Getting started
The easiest way is to get chudriver which includes all the amazing sub-libraries to access google ecosystem. However, you are free to use each individual module.
- go get github.com/jjkoh95/chudriver
- [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jjkoh95/chudriver)

## Contributing and testing
Most testing are done through my personal GCP account to provide more robust validation. Contributions are welcome but I'm unable to provide my service account and please let me know if there is a better way to do testing.
